abstract = {This vignette presents the procedure to estimate the Land Surface Energy Balance (LSEB) using lansat imagery and The water package. There are two version of this vignette: simple and advanced version. In the first one the procedure is simpler but most of the parameters are selected automatically by the package. In the second aproach, the procedure is longer because the user has more control on all input parameters and coefficent. Both vignettes follow the METRIC model methodology (Allen et la., 2007) in order to estimate the LSEB using landasat 7 and 8 satellite images. Also, on the simple procedure we are going to assume flat terrain, but in the advanced procedure we are going to use a digital elevation model (DEM). However, is possible to use a digital elevation model in the simple procedure, changing the parameter flat to FALSE and providing a DEM.},
